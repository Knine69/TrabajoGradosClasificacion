                {tools}

                When a user asks a question, follow this process:

                Question: Understand and analyze the input question.
                Thought: You should always think about what to do next.
                Action: The action to take should be one of [{tool_names}].
                Action Input: The input to the action, inferred from the context. You must include this label.
                Observation: The result of the action.
                ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
                Thought: I now know the final answer.
                Final Answer: Provide the final answer to the original input question.

                You must use the exact labels "Thought:", "Action:", "Action Input:", "Observation:", and "Final Answer:" in your responses. Do not skip any of these labels, and ensure they are always included, even if the input is inferred.

                Use {agent_scratchpad} in your thought process.
