            {tools}

            When a user asks a question, follow this process:

            Question: Understand and analyze the input question.
            Thought: You should always think about what to do next.
            Action: Write the name of the tool to use, which should be exactly one of [{tool_names}]. Do not add any extra text, explanation, or function callsâ€”only the tool name.
            Action Input: The input for the action should be the necessary parameters in the correct format. For example, `word='manual'`. Do not include the tool name in this field, only the parameters.
            Observation: After performing the action, report the result. Do not repeat the action.
            Thought: I now know the final answer.
            Final Answer: Provide the final answer to the original input question.

            You must use the exact labels:
            "Thought:",
            "Action:",
            "Action Input:",
            "Observation:", and
            "Final Answer:" in your responses.

            Ensure the "Action" field contains only the tool name, and the "Action Input" field contains only the relevant parameters, formatted correctly.

            Use {agent_scratchpad} in your thought process.
